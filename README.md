## diff

A tool to visually compare Scala data structures with out of the box support for arbitrary case classes.

Be aware: Collections (List, Seq, etc.) are compared like sets, i.e. ignoring order.

### SBT Dependency

`"ai.x" %% "diff" % "1.0"`

### Usage

```scala
println(  ai.x.diff.DiffShow.diff( before, after ).string  )
```

#### Output

#### Code

```scala
sealed trait Parent
case class Bar( s: String, i: Int ) extends Parent
case class Foo( bar: Bar, b: List[Int], parent: Option[Parent] ) extends Parent

val before: Foo = Foo(
  Bar( "asdf", 5 ),
  List( 123, 1234 ),
  Some( Bar( "asdf", 5 ) )
)
val after: Foo = Foo(
  Bar( "asdf", 66 ),
  List( 1234 ),
  Some( Bar( "qwer", 5 ) )
)
```

### Helpful tips

```scala
import ai.x.diff._
```

#### Custom comparison

Sometimes you may need to write your own type class instances. For example for non-case classes that don't compare well using ==.

```scala
implicit def localTimeDiffShow = {
  val show = ( d: org.joda.time.LocalTime ) => "LocalTime(" + d.toString + ")"
  DiffShow.create[org.joda.time.LocalTime]( show, ( l, r ) =>
    if ( l isEqual r ) Identical( show( l ) ) else Different( showChange( show( l ), show( r ) ) ) )
}
```

#### Ignore parts of data

Sometimes you may want to ignore some parts of your data during comparison.
You can do so by type, e.g. for non-deterministic parts like ObjectId, which always differ.

```scala
def ignore[T] = new DiffShow[T] {
  def show( t: T ) = t.toString
  def diff( left: T, right: T ) = Identical( "<not compared>" )
  override def diffable( left: T, right: T ) = true
}
implicit def LocationIdShow: DiffShow[LocationId] = ignore[LocationId]
```

#### Influence comparison in collections

When comparing collections you can influence if two elements should be compared or treated as completely different.
Comparing elements shows their partial differences. Not comparing them shows them as added or removed.

```scala
implicit def PersonDiffShow[L <: HList](
  implicit
  labelled:  LabelledGeneric.Aux[Person, L],
  hlistShow: Lazy[DiffShowFields[L]]
): DiffShow[Person] = new CaseClassDiffShow[Person, L] {
  override def diffable( left: Person, right: Person ) = left._id === right._id
}
```
